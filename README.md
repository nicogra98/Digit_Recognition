# Digit_Recognition
Handwritten Digit Recognition using the MNSIT dataset using keras, tensorflow, PIL, numpy and python

### Dependecies

`tensorflow, keras, numpy, matplotlib and PIL` for the development of the neuronal network  
`tkinter, PIL, numpy and keras` for the GUI  

### Contents
`MNIST.h5` The output of the trained model  
`MNIST.ipynb` Jupyter notebook used to develop and train the neural network  
`app.py` The gui used to predict the digits written by the user  

### Usage
`python app.py` To launch the GUI then draw a digit (0-9) and press on the recognize button. After that it will show
the prediction made by the model and how sure the model is about its prediction. Press clear to clear the canvas
and draw another digit
